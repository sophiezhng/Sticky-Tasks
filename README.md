# Sticky-Tasks
Android app i made NOT FINISHED

My project is an Android app that utilizes the SQLite Database to save virtual colored sticky notes containing tasks. Each task is added in descending order when added and has a saved boolean value for if it is checked/done. It can be sorted visually with different color tasks or by being dragged and dropped to the target position. The user's progress towards "completing" all their designated tasks is indicated by a synced progress bar near the top of the screen.
